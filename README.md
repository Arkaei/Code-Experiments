# Code-Experiments

This is my first little repository for sharing the things I learn and the experiments I do.

I'll try to share starter to intermediate pieces of code and projects semi regularly.

I hope this to be both a learning/practicing tool for those who are new like me and also kind of a résumé for myself.

And last but not least , any and all contributions and suggestions are really really welcome.
